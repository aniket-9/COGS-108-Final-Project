    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " __DATA SCIENCE QUESTION(S) & HYPOTHESIS:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proposed Question\n",
    "    - How does the frequency of traffic collisions change based on street quality index, traffic volume, and parking meter locations in the city of San Diego?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypothesis\n",
    "    - We hypothesize that traffic collisions in San Diego will have a higher frequency on streets that have lower OCI’s (Overall Condition Index), higher traffic volume, and will depend on the number of parking meters,  in an area (and thereby, variance of available parking spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "We think this topic has ample scope to explore a very important civil and social safety issue. By analysing how traffic collisions vary based on a variety of factors in our own city of San Diego, we plan to find the best way to reduce collisions generally. Although this is a specific analysis in only one city, we hope that highly correlational variables can be recognized with global applicability, at least to some degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety is the number one priority when driving. Unfortunately, traffic collisions and rule breaking happen regularly and can range from minor incidents to severe injuries and even death. The number of traffic collisions in San Diego increase every year, and this could potentially affect UCSD students and faculty as many people use cars to commute to and from school. As students of UCSD, we want to find out if San Diego traffic collisions are affected by factors such as street quality, traffic density and the number of parking meters in an effort to gain a better understanding of which areas are most prone to collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a multitude of prior research that has studied the relationship between traffic collisions and different factors such as parking and driver behavior, in an attempt to improve road safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, it is important to note that in Miller’s (2016) article, he recognizes that “while pedestrian-related collisions made up a very small share of priority corridor collisions, they comprised over two-thirds (67%) of the fatal collisions on those roadways.” Considering the statistics on the amount of accidents that include pedestrians, there is a big concern that the collisions on the road may affect those who aren’t in a vehicle. This increases the awareness of how deadly these collisions can be, and will continue to be, if there aren’t preventative measures taken for both the pedestrian and driver. In addition, there has been a study by NYU that determined a “71% correlation between risky driving behavior and traffic accidents and concluded that safer driving habits would help to prevent future traffic accidents” (Bousquet, 2017).  The percentage of parking-related midblock accidents increase as the size of streets decrease from a highway to a local street (Jack B. Humphreys & Donald J. Wheeler 1979). Highways do not have parking, but smaller local roads have parking spaces and meters by the sidewalk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although these studies have found that these behaviors seem to play a big factor in road accidents, our team wants to research the cause of collisions from a different perspective. With the pressing issue of the increase in traffic collisions every year, we wanted to find more data on whether the OCI (Overall Condition Index), traffic volume, and the number of parking meters and/or spaces have played a role in the road accidents, in hopes that future preventative measures will be made.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are links to the datasets to be used in this project(as of now, more datasets may be added as needed):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traffic Collisions dataset: https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-collisions/\n",
    "- Street quality datasets:https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/streets-overall-condition-index/\n",
    "- Parking meter dataset: https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/parking-meters-locations/\n",
    "- Traffic volumes dataset: https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/traffic-volumes/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The traffic collisions dataset includes all kinds of unlawful acts caught by the local police, such as taking illegal turns, stop requirements, and hit and runs. There are a total of 22,862 observations and with each observation, there is an indicated date, time, street number, street name, street type, violation type, and the number of people injured or killed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The street quality datasets contains two sets of data measuring the quality of streets in San Diego based on an Overall Condition Index (OCI). One data set is from 2011 and contains 28,098 observations whereas the other data set is from 2015 and contains 30,712 observations. Each observation has an overall condition index, street name, segment length, segment width, the square footage of the segment, what type of street and pavement it is, and a description on whether it is good, fair or poor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parking meter dataset contains the location of parking meters in San Diego. There are a total of 4668 observations and each observation has a zone, an area, a sub-area and the meter’s longitude and latitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "The traffic volumes dataset contains the count of vehicles on city streets reported in the form of Average Daily Traffic (ADT). This gives us a good idea of the average traffic volume on each street. There are 11659 observations and each observation has the date the observation was made, the street a segment is on, the cross street limits of a segment, and the counts of cars going north, east, west, and southbound. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the datasets cover records over the past couple years, hence giving a large enough combined dataset to work with. We plan to extract the features our project is concerned with, and combine them sensibly into one dataset for ease of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning the data will be required as many entries under some columns are not filled. Fortunately, since these are mostly names of streets we do not need them(we will use the street locations and codes instead). We might also find that features such as police beats considerably influence traffic collision frequency during exploratory analysis, and may decide to include features based on degree of correlation.\n"
